            <h1><span>Customer Reviews</span></h1>
            <p>Visited as a guest in the Echo restaurant for lunch just today. We were entertaining friends from California, and enjoyed our ocean side table. We chose to stay indoors - to enjoy the air conditioning ðŸ˜Š. I just want to say that, in addition to a nice meal, we had a delightful waitress, Jackie.  </p>
